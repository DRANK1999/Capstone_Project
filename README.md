# Hospital Cost Analysis - Capstone Project

## Overview
This repository contains my capstone project completed as part of the CSI Data Analytics Bootcamp. The project focuses on analyzing hospital costs using data from a simulated Hospital Management System.

The original dataset is publicly available on Kaggle:  
[Hospital Management System Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mshamoonbutt/hospital-management-system)

## Whatâ€™s Included

- **SQL Queries:** The SQL scripts used to extract, clean, and analyze the data from the database.
- **Excel Files:** Resulting tables from the SQL queries are exported and included in Excel files for further analysis.
- **Variable Map (Data Model):** A diagram showing the relationships between tables and the key variables used in the analysis.
- **Final Report:** A comprehensive document summarizing the analysis, findings, and insights.
- **Dashboard:** An interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes key hospital cost metrics.

## Tableau Dashboard
